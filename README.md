# libvirt-provider


`libvirt-provider` is a Libvirt based provider implementation of the [ironcore](https://github.com/ironcore-dev/ironcore) `Machine` type.

Please consult the [project documentation](https://ironcore-dev.github.io/libvirt-provider/) for additional information.





### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster
